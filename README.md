#Generic simulation bundle for the OpenWorm simulation engine / http://openworm.org

This is a generic simulation loader that will retrieve a given simulation from config, discover required OSGi services dynamically based on cofig parameters and will initiate/control the simulation in a generic way.

This is a sample config file for reference: https://www.dropbox.com/s/iyr085zcegyis0n/sph-sim-config.xml?dl=1

The config file is to be intended as a "project file" for a given simulation.
