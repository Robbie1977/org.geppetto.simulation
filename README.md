#Geppetto simulation bundle

This is a generic simulation module that will retrieve a given simulation from a configuration file, discover required OSGi services dynamically based on config parameters and will initialize the simulators and model interpreters required to perform the loaded simulation.

(This)[https://github.com/openworm/org.geppetto.samples/blob/master/LEMS/SingleComponentHH/GEPPETTO.xml] is a sample simulation file for reference.
